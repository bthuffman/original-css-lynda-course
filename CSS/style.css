/*Alternatives to this external method of applying CSS to html is to../
    INTERNAL CSS:
        Included in the head, uses the <style></style> tag to enclose the CSS styles and must always be between them.
        This is  ok for one page websites, but tedious for multiple pages as you'd have to update the style block on
        each of them.
    INLINE STYLES:
        Included in HTML element as an attribute (ex. <p style="color:blue;".
        Should be used sparingly.
        Specificity issues can arise as inline styles take precedence over internal and external CSS.
    NOTE: Best practices for programming in general is the more efficient, flexible and easy to maintain the codebase
     is the better. */
